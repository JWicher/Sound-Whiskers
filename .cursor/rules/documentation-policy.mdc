# Documentation Policy

## Do NOT Create Documentation Automatically

**Unless the user explicitly asks for documentation, do NOT create any documentation files**, including:
- Implementation plans
- Verification documents
- Summary files
- Troubleshooting guides
- Setup guides
- Status files
- Any `.md` files or documentation

## When to Create Documentation

Only create documentation when:
1. The user explicitly asks: "Create documentation...", "Write a guide...", etc.
2. The user requests a specific document type
3. The user says "document this" or similar explicit request

## Guidelines

- Focus on code implementation and direct problem-solving
- Keep notes and planning internal to the conversation
- If you create something, ask first before saving it as a documentation file
- Suggest documentation to the user if it would be helpful, but don't create it without permission
